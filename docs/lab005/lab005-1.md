# Monitoring, Metering, and Metrics

A significant architectural shift toward containers is underway and, as with any architectural shift, this brings new operational challenges. It can be challenging for many of the legacy monitoring tools to monitor container platforms in fast moving, often ephemeral environments. The good news is newer cloud-based offerings can ensure monitoring solutions are as scalable as the services being built and monitored. These new solutions have evolved to address the growing need to monitor your stack from the bottom to the top.

From an operations point of view, infrastructure monitoring tools collect metrics about the host or container, such as CPU load, available memory and network I/O.

The default monitoring stack is the 3-pronged open source approach of, Grafana, Alertmanager, and Prometheus.

***Prometheus*** gives you finely grained metrics at a huge scale. With the right configuration, Prometheus can handle millions of time series.

***Grafana*** can visualize the data being scraped by Prometheus. Grafana comes with pre-built dashboards for typical use cases, or you can create your own custom ones.

***Alertmanager*** forwards alerts to a service such as Slack or another webhook . Alertmanager can use metadata to classify alerts into groups such as errors, notifications, etc.

The Grafana-Alertmanager-Prometheus monitoring stack provides a highly configurable, open source option to monitor Kubernetes workloads.
