# Cloning the GitHub Repository and Reviewing its Contents

!!! Important
    Work In Progress

In the terminal session, you should have been automatically placed in your home directory `/home/userNN` (where NN is your user number).

1. **Run the command `pwd` to check your current working directory**.

    ???+ example "Example Output"

        ```bash
        user01@lab061:~$ pwd
        /home/user01
        ```

1. If you are in any other directory, **change into the correct home directory using the command `cd /home/userNN`** (where NN is your user number).

    ???+ example "Example Output"

        ```bash
        user01@lab061:~$ cd /home/user01
        user01@lab061:~$ pwd
        /home/user01
        ```

1. **In your home directory, clone the OpenShift Service Mesh repository using the command**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mmondics/istio-s390x -b ocp-wildfire
    ```

    ???+ example "Example Output"

        ```bash
        user01@lab061:~$ git clone https://github.com/mmondics/istio-s390x -b ocp-wildfire
        Cloning into 'istio-s390x'...
        remote: Enumerating objects: 171, done.
        remote: Counting objects: 100% (171/171), done.

        ```

1. This will create a new directory called istio-s390x. **Change into this directory using the command**:

    ```bash
    cd istio-s390x 
    ```

1. **Then list its contents using the command**:

    ```bash
    ls -l
    ```

    ???+ example "Example Output"

        ```bash
        user01@lab061:~$ cd Istio-s390x
        user01@lab061:~/istio-s390x$ total 32
