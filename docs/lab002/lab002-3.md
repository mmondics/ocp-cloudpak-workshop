# Overview of the OpenShift CLI

1. In your terminal, **enter the command**:

    ```bash
    oc --help
    ```

    ???+ example "Example Output"

        ```
        user01@lab061:~$ oc --help
        OpenShift Client

        This client helps you develop, build, deploy, and run your applications on any
        OpenShift or Kubernetes cluster. It also includes the administrative
        commands for managing a cluster under the 'adm' subcommand.

        Usage:
        oc [flags]

        Basic Commands:
        login           Log in to a server
        new-project     Request a new project
        new-app         Create a new application
        status          Show an overview of the current project
        project         Switch to another project
        projects        Display existing projects
        explain         Documentation of resources

        Build and Deploy Commands:
        rollout         Manage a Kubernetes deployment or OpenShift deployment config
        rollback        Revert part of an application back to a previous deployment
        new-build       Create a new build configuration
        start-build     Start a new build
        ```
    The `--help` flag will display all of the available options the oc CLI.

1. **Enter the following command**

    ```bash
    oc new-app --help
    ```

    ???+ example "Example Output"

        ```
        user01@lab061:~$ oc new-app --help
        Create a new application by specifying source code, templates, and/or images

        This command will try to build up the components of an application using images, templates, or code
        that has a public repository. It will lookup the images on the local Docker installation (if
        available), a container image registry, an integrated image stream, or stored templates.

        If you specify a source code URL, it will set up a build that takes your source code and converts
        it into an image that can run inside of a pod. Local source must be in a git repository that has a
        remote repository that the server can see. The images will be deployed via a deployment
        configuration, and a service will be connected to the first public port of the app. You may either
        specify components using the various existing flags or let new-app autodetect what kind of
        components you have provided.

        If you provide source code, a new build will be automatically triggered. You can use 'oc status' to
        check the progress.

        Usage:
        oc new-app (IMAGE | IMAGESTREAM | TEMPLATE | PATH | URL ...) [flags]

        Examples:
        # List all local templates and image streams that can be used to create an app
        oc new-app --list
        
        # Create an application based on the source code in the current git repository (with a public
        remote) and a Docker image
        oc new-app . --docker-image=repo/langimage
        ```
    The `--help` flag now displays all of the available options for the oc new-app command. If you get confused about any of the commands we use in this workshop, or just want more information, using this flag is a good first step.
