# Cleaning Up

1. **Double check that you are in your own userNN-project by issuing the command**:

    ```text
    oc project
    ```

    ???+ example "Example Output"

        ```text
        user01@lab061:~$ oc project
        Using project "user01-project" on server "https://api.atsocppa.dmz:6443".
        ```

1. **Once you’re sure you’re in your own project, issue the following command to delete all objects associated with your application labeled mongodb-ephemeral**.  

    ```text
    oc delete all --selector app=mongodb-ephemeral -o name
    ```

    ???+ example "Example Output"

        ```text
        user01@lab061:~$ oc delete all --selector app=mongodb-ephemeral -o name
        replicationcontroller/mongodb-1
        service/mongodb
        deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/mongodb
        ```

1. **Run the following command to check that all of your mongo application resources were deleted**:

    ```text
    oc get all
    ```

    ???+ example "Example Output"

        ```text
        user01@lab061:~$ oc get all
        No resources found.
        user00@lab061:~$
        ```

1. (***Optional***) **If there are leftover resources from other labs that you would like to delete, run the command**:

    ```text
    oc delete all --all
    ```

    ???+ example "Example Output"

        ```text
        user01@lab061:~$ oc delete all --all
        pod "rails-postgresql-example-1-build" deleted
        service "postgresql" deleted
        service "rails-postgresql-example" deleted
        buildconfig.build.openshift.io "rails-postgresql-example" deleted
        build.build.openshift.io "rails-postgresql-example-1" deleted
        imagestream.image.openshift.io "rails-postgresql-example" deleted
        route.route.openshift.io "rails-postgresql-example" deleted
        ```
