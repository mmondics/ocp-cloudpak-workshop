# The OpenShift Command Line (oc)

The OpenShift command line `oc` is a command line tool that can be used to create applications and manage OpenShift projects. `oc` is ideal in situations where you:

* Work directly with project source code.
* Script OpenShift Container Platform operations.
* Are restricted by bandwidth resources and cannot use the web console.

Furthermore, many people familiar with Linux and/or Kubernetes tend to find the `oc` command line an easier and more efficient method of performing tasks, rather than the web-based console.

Like with the OpenShift web console, the OpenShift command line includes functions both [for developers](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/cli_reference/openshift_cli/developer-cli-commands.html) and for [administrators](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/cli_reference/openshift_cli/administrator-cli-commands.html).
