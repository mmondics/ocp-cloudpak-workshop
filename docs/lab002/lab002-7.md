# Administrative CLI Commands

If you’ve already completed [Exploring the OpenShift Console](../lab001/lab001-1.md), you’ll remember that there are both developer and administrator perspectives. The same is true in the OpenShift CLI. 

The `oc adm` command gives cluster administrators the ability to check logs, manage users, groups, policies, certificates, and many other tasks usually associated with administrative roles.

1. **Issue the following command to see all of the OpenShift administrator commands**.

    ```text
    oc adm --help
    ```

    ???+ example "Example Output"

        ```text
        user01@lab061:~$ oc adm --help

1. **Run the following administrative command to show see usage statistics for pods in your project**.

    ```text
    oc adm top pods
    ```

    ???+ example "Example Output"

        ```text
        user01@lab061:~$ oc adm top pods
        NAME            CPU(cores)   MEMORY(bytes)   
        httpd-example-1-92k2t   0m           32Mi
        httpd-example-1-pgxxp   1m           37Mi
        httpd-example-1-q77kh   2m           33Mi
        ```

    As OpenShift clusters grow in production, administrative commands like this one become more and more essential to keep everything running smoothly.
