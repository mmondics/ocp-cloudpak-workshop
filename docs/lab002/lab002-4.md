# Deploy Container Image from the CLI

`oc new-app` is a powerful and commonly used command in the OpenShift CLI. It has the ability to deploy applications from components that include:

* Source or binary code
* Container images
* Templates

The set of objects created by `oc new-app` depends on the artifacts passed as an input.

1. **Run the following command to start a MongoDB deployment from a template**:

    ```bash
    oc new-app mongo
    ```

    ???+ example "Example Output"

        ```bash
        user01@lab061:~$ oc new-app --template=mongodb-ephemeral
        --> Deploying template "openshift/mongodb-ephemeral" to project user01-project

            Application is not exposed. You can expose services to the outside world by executing one or more of the commands below:
            'oc expose svc/mongodb' 
            Run 'oc status' to view your app.
        ```
    ???+ Note
        Notice a few things:

        * OpenShift went out and found a template that matches your desired deployment – MongoDB-ephemeral.

        * You’re told what exactly is going to be created and what it will be named.

        * Those objects are then created within your project space.

        * You’re told that the application was successfully deployed, but it is not yet exposed. This means that it’s running, but it’s not accessible from outside the cluster.

1. **Run the following command** to view the app in your project space:

    ```bash
    oc status
    ```

    ???+ example "Example Output"
        ```bash
        user01@lab061:~$ oc status
        In project user01-project on server https://api.atsocpd1.dmz:6443

        svc/mongodb - 172.30.94.118:27017
        dc/mongodb deploys istag/mongodb:latest 
            deployment #1 deployed 3 minutes ago - 1 pod

        View details with 'oc describe <resource>/<name>' or list everything with 'oc get all'.
        ```
1. Now **run the following command** to see all of the objects that were built:

    ```bash
    oc get all
    ```

    ???+ example "Example Output"

        ```bash
        user01@lab061:~$ oc get all
        NAME                 READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
        pod/mongodb-1-deploy   0/1     Completed   0          5m30s
        pod/mongodb-1-sj6mk    1/1     Running     0          5m22s

        NAME                            DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
        replicationcontroller/mongodb-1   1         1         1       5m30s

        NAME            TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)     AGE
        service/mongodb   ClusterIP   172.30.94.118   <none>        27017/TCP   5m32s

        NAME                                       REVISION   DESIRED   CURRENT   TRIGGERED BY
        deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/mongodb   1          1         1       config,image(mongodb:3.6)
        ```

    These are the objects that OpenShift told us would be created, and they all work together to run the application. While they’re all important pieces of this puzzle, *pods* are where the application code is actually running. Let’s narrow down on our pods.

    ???+ Note
        You might also have objects left over from other labs if they were not completely cleaned out. This is okay and the objects for different applications will not interfere with one another due to their use of *labels*.

1. **Run the command**:

    ```bash
    oc get pods
    ```

    ???+ example "Example Output"

        ```bash
        user01@lab061:~$ oc get pods
        NAME             READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
        mongodb-1-deploy   0/1     Completed   0          28s
        mongodb-1-r8dpw    1/1     Running     0          19s
        ```

    The `oc new-app` command created two pods. One ending with “deploy”, and the other ending with a randomly-generated string of 5 characters (r8dpw in the screenshot above). They are both associated with your mongo deployment, but one is in a *Completed* status, and one is *Running*. The *Completed* pod had one simple job – scale the other pod to its desired count of 1.

1. **Run the following command** to see the logs for the deploy pod

    ```bash
    oc logs pod/mongodb-1-deploy
    ```

    ???+ example "Example Output"

        ```bash
        user01@lab061:~$ oc logs pod/mongodb-1-deploy
        --> Scaling mongodb-1 to 1
        --> Success
        ```

    That’s a pretty simple responsibility. The second pod, ending in the randomly generated string of characters, has a much more complicated job. This is the pod where the MongoDB application code is actually running.

1. **Run the following command** to see the logs for the MongoDB deployment:

    ```bash
    oc logs pod/mongodb-1-XXXXX
    ```

    Where `XXXXX` is your unique string of characters that you saw in the `oc get pods` output.

    ???+ example "Example Output"

        ```bash
        user01@lab061:~$ oc logs pod/mongodb-1-r8dpw

        ```

    This is obviously a much busier pod. One of the first lines in its log tells you which version of MongoDB is running.

In the next section, you will connect to the pod and see that it is actually running MongoDB.
