# Working with Pods

One of the main benefits of using containers and Kubernetes-based cloud platforms like OpenShift is the ability to *scale horizontally* – rapidly duplicating or deleting pods to meet a desired state.

???+ Information
    One of the core concepts of Kubernetes is the *Declarative State*. Users *declare* what resources they want, and Kubernetes does whatever it can to make that happen. Scaling is one example of this.

Scaling essentially creates copies of the application in order to distribute traffic to multiple instances and/or compute nodes for high availability and load balancing.

1. **Enter the following command** to get the name of your MongoDB deploymentconfig (dc)

    ```text
    oc get dc
    ```

    ???+ example "Example Output"

        ```text
        user01@lab061:~$ oc get dc
        NAME    REVISION   DESIRED   CURRENT   TRIGGERED BY
        mongodb   1          1         1         config,image(mongodb:3.6)
        ```

    Your deploymentconfig named `mongo` has a count desired = current = 1.

1. **Scale the mongo deployment to 3 replicas**:

    ```text
    oc scale dc/mongodb --replicas=3
    ```

    ???+ example "Example Output"

        ```text
        user01@lab061:~$ oc scale dc/mongodb --replicas=3
        deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/mongodb scaled
        ```

1. **Enter the following command again** to see the scaled application.

    ```text
    oc get dc
    ```

    ???+ example "Example Output"
        ```text
        user01@lab061:~$ oc get dc
        NAME    REVISION   DESIRED   CURRENT   TRIGGERED BY
        mongodb   1          3         3         config,image(mongodb:3.6)
        ```

    This output is telling you that OpenShift knows that you want three copies (pods) of MongoDB, and it is successfully meeting that declared state.

1. **Enter the following command again to see your three pods**:

    ```text
    oc get pods
    ```

    ???+ example "Example Output"
        ```text
        user01@lab061:~$ oc get pods
        NAME             READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
        mongodb-1-5nmjn    1/1     Running     0          2m6s
        mongodb-1-deploy   0/1     Completed   0          20m
        mongodb-1-dh49x    1/1     Running     0          2m6s
        mongodb-1-r8dpw    1/1     Running     0          19m
        ```

    Two of the pods will have a shorter age than the original one – these are the two new pods that were just created when you scaled the application.

1. **Dig into the pods a little bit further by entering the following command**:

    ```text
    oc describe pod/mongodb-1-XXXXX
    ```

    Where `XXXXX` is one of your unique strings of characters.

    ???+ example "Example Output"

        ```text
        user01@lab061:~$ oc describe pod/mongodb-1-5nmjn
        Name:               mongodb-1-5nmjn
        Namespace:          user01-project
        Priority:           0
        PriorityClassName:  <none>
        Node:               worker-0.atsocppa.dmz/192.168.176.175
        Start Time:         Wed, 15 Apr 2020 13:13:53 -0400
        Labels:             app=mongodb
                            deployment=mongodb-1
                            deploymentconfig=mongodb

        ```

    This command gives you all kinds of information about your pod. Notice the `Node:` field that begins with `worker-#`.

1. **Run the same command again, but on a different pod this time**:

    ```text
    oc describe pod/mongodb-1-YYYYY
    ```

    Where `YYYYY` is one of your other unique strings of characters. Pick one different than the previous step.

    ???+ example "Example Output"

        ```text
        user01@lab061:~$ oc describe pod/mongodb-1-r8dpw
        Name:               mongodb-1-r8dpw
        Namespace:          user01-project
        Priority:           0
        PriorityClassName:  <none>
        Node:               worker-2.atsocppa.dmz/192.168.176.177
        Start Time:         Wed, 15 Apr 2020 12:56:03 -0400
        Labels:             app=mongodb
                            deployment=mongodb-1
                            deploymentconfig=mongodb
        ```

    It is likely (but not guaranteed) that this pod has been placed on a *different* compute node than the first pod you described. The reason for this is that you have three compute nodes in this OpenShift cluster, and Kubernetes balances the load for this application across multiple nodes.
