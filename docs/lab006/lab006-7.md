# Cleaning Up

There is no easy way to delete all of these objects from the OpenShift console. This is a much easier task in the OpenShift command line.

1. In the OpenShift CLI, **make sure you are in your own project** (i.e. userNN-project) **and run the following command**:

    ```bash
    oc delete all --all
    ```

    ???+ Note
        If you are not connected to the OpenShift command line, refer to [Using the OpenShift Command Line](../../lab002/lab002-1).

This will delete most of the objects in your project, but not the Persistent Volume Claim you created.

1. **To delete the PVC, run the command**:

    ```bash
    oc delete pvc/pvc-userNN
    ```

    Where `NN` is your user number.
