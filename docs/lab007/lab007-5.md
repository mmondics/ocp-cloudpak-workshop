# Access the Application in a Browser

Your application is running and accessible via the exposed route.

1. **In a web browser, navigate to the route**:

    <http://modresort-userNN.apps.atsocppa.dmz/resorts/>

    Where NN is your user number.

The demo application used (mod resorts) is admittedly a simple use-case with no dependencies on external resources, so you will notice that most of the links do not function. In real-world applications, there will be dependencies on external resources which can be integrated using various OpenShift and Kubernetes objects such as ConfigMaps, Volume mounts, secrets, etc.
