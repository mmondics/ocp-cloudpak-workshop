Note: this lab is a modified version of the GitHub repository here:

Open Liberty:

* is a lightweight, open framework for building fast and efficient cloud-native Java microservices
* is fast to start up with low memory footprint and live reload for quick iteration.
* is simple to add and remove features from the latest versions of MicroProfile and Java EE.
* requires zero migration lets you focus on what's important, not the APIs changing under you.

The [Open Liberty Operator](https://github.com/OpenLiberty/open-liberty-operator) can be used to deploy and manage [Open Liberty](https://github.com/OpenLiberty) applications into OpenShift clusters. You can also perform Day-2 operations such as gathering traces and dumps using the operator.

Because the Open Liberty Operator watches all namespaces in the OpenShift cluster, workshop users are not required to deploy the Operator itself. It has already been deployed in the openshift-operators project.
