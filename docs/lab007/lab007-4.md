# Using the Open Liberty Operator to Install an Application

1. **Edit the environment variables file to match your user number (NN)**.

    ```text
    sed -i 's/NN/YOUR_USER_NUMBER/g' env
    ```

    !!! Important
        Make sure that you replace YOUR_USER_NUMBER in the command above.

1. **Run the command** `cat env` **to check that the two instances of** `NN` **were properly replaced with your user number**.

    With your modified environment variables file env, you’re ready to run the shell script `1-build.sh` that will use *Buildah* to build a container image from the Dockerfile, and *Podman* to push the image into OpenShift’s internal registry.

    Before running this script, take a look at the steps it will go through.

1. **View the script contents using the command**:

    ```text
    cat 1-build.sh
    ```

    ???+ example "Example Output"

        ```text
        #!/bin/text

        unset KUBECONFIG

        . ./env

        echo "Logging into OpenShift"
        oc login $OPENSHIFT_API_URL \
            --username=$OPENSHIFT_USERNAME \
            --password=$OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD \
            --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true

        echo "Logging into OpenShift image registry"
        podman login \
            --username $OPENSHIFT_USERNAME \
            --password $(oc whoami -t) \
            --tls-verify=false \
            $OPENSHIFT_REGISTRY_URL

        echo "Switch to $OPENSHIFT_PROJECT"
        oc project $OPENSHIFT_PROJECT

        echo "Building the container image"
        buildah build-using-dockerfile \
        -t ${OPENSHIFT_REGISTRY_URL}/$OPENSHIFT_PROJECT/app-modernization:v1.0.0 \
            .

        echo "Pushing the container image to the OpenShift image registry"
        podman push --tls-verify=false \
        ${OPENSHIFT_REGISTRY_URL}/${OPENSHIFT_PROJECT}/app-modernization:v1.0.0

        ```

    This shell script:

    * Logs you into the OpenShift cluster.
    * Logs you into the OpenShift cluster’s internal image registry.
    * Switches to your project, if not currently working in it.
    * Builds the container image using the Dockerfile contained in your working directory.
    * Pushes the new container image from step 4 to the cluster’s internal image registry.

    ???+ Note
        Note that you are welcome to enter each command manually and individually, but the scripting is there to minimize the opportunity for typos and other errors. If you do enter each command manually, make sure to replace each variable in BLUE with the actual value itself. Also, notice that the forward slash \ simply breaks a single command into multiple lines.

1. You might notice that the `Dockerfile` is doing the brunt of the work in this script to build the container image itself. **Take a look at this too, using the command**:

    ```text
    cat Dockerfile
    ```

    ???+ example "Example Output"

        ```Dockerfile
        FROM quay.io/mmondics/open-liberty:latest
        COPY --chown=1001:0 modresorts-1.0.war /config/dropins
        COPY --chown=1001:0 server.xml /config/

        ```

    This `Dockerfile` pulls the Open Liberty Java EE 8 image from Quay.io then adds the `modresorts-1.0.war` binary and `server.xml` configuration file to the base image.

    Back in the `ol-app-install` working directory, you can now run the script that brings all of these pieces together.

1. **Run the script using the command**:

    ```text
    ./1-build.sh
    ```

    ???+ example "Example Output"

        ```text
        user01@lab061:~/openliberty-operator-ocpz/ol-app-install$ ./1-build.sh

    Your container image is now built and pushed into OpenShift’s internal registry.

1. **View your new image in the registry using the command**:

    ```text
    podman images
    ```

    ???+ example "Example Output"

        ```text
        user01@lab061:~/openliberty-operator-ocpz/ol-app-install$ podman images

        ```

    With the app-modernization image in the OpenShift internal registry, it can now be used to deploy an application into the cluster.

    You have one more file to edit before deploying the Mod Resorts sample application.

1. **Edit the custom resource file using the command**:

    ```text
    sed -i 's/NN/YOUR_USER_NUMBER/g' app-mod-withroute_cr.yaml
    ```

    !!! Important
        Make sure that you replace YOUR_USER_NUMBER in the command above.

1. **Run the command**:

    ```text
    cat app-mod-withroute_cr.yaml
    ```
    
    And make sure that the two instances of `NN` were properly replaced with your user number.

    ??? Information "Expand for More Information"
        What exactly is this YAML file?

        A *Custom Resource Definition (CRD)* object defines a new, unique object in the cluster and lets the Kubernetes API server handle its entire lifecycle. *Custom Resource (CR)* objects are created from CRDs that have been added to the cluster by a cluster administrator, allowing all cluster users to add the new resource type into projects.

        So in this case, a CRD was created ahead of time of the kind: OpenLibertyApplication, and you are creating a CR from that CRD. 

    With the modified app-mod-withroute_cr.yaml file, you’re ready to run the second script, `2-deploy.sh`. Before running it, take a look at what all it will do.

1. **Run the command**:

    ```text
    cat 2-deploy.sh
    ```

    ???+ example "Example Output"

        ```text
        #!/bin/text

        unset KUBECONFIG

        . ./env

        echo "Logging into OpenShift"
        oc login $OPENSHIFT_API_URL \
            --username=$OPENSHIFT_USERNAME \
            --password=$OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD \
            --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true

        echo "Creating OpenLiberty Custom Resource"
        oc -n $OPENSHIFT_PROJECT create -f app-mod-withroute_cr.yaml
        ```

    This shell script:

    * Logs you into the OpenShift cluster.
    * Creates an object from the Custom Resource (CR) YAML file you just edited.

1. **Run this shell script with the command**:

    ```text
    ./2-deploy.sh
    ```

    ???+ example "Example Output"

        ```text
        user01@lab061:~/openliberty-operator-ocpz/ol-app-install$ ./2-deploy.sh
        Logging into Openshift
        Login successful.

        You have access to 170 projects, the list has been suppressed. You can list all projects with 'oc projects'

        Using project "user01-project".
        Creating Openliberty Custom Resource Definition
        openlibertyapplication.openliberty.io/appmod created
        ```

    Your Custom Resource named `appmod` of kind `OpenLibertyApplication` has been `created` in your project, `userNN-project`.  The creation of this CR resulted in the Open Liberty Operator deploying a pod, deployment, replicaset, and a service that is exposed as a route.

1. **View all of the created objects using the command**:

    ```text
    oc get all
    ```
