# Cleaning Up

1. When you’re ready to finish the lab and delete the objects you created, **return to your terminal and double check that you’re in your own userNN-project with**:

    ```text
    oc project
    ```

    ???+ example "Example Output"

        ```text
        user01@lab061:~/openshift-pipelines-s390x$ oc project
        Using project "user00-project" on server "https://api.atsocpd2.dmz:6443".
        ```

1. **Run the uninstall script**:

    ```text
    ./pipeline-cleanup.sh
    ```

    ???+ example "Example Output"

        ```text
        user01@lab061:~/openshift-pipelines-s390x$ ./pipeline-cleanup.sh
