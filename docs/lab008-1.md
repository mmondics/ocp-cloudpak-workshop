# Lab 008 - Deploying an Application with Quarkus Red Hat Runtime

!!! Note
    For more Quarkus guides, see the official site here: <https://quarkus.io/guides/>

***Quarkus*** is a full-stack, Kubernetes-native Java framework optimized specifically for containers and Kubernetes environments. It is designed to work with popular Java standards, frameworks, and libraries like Eclipse MicroProfile, Spring Apache Kafka, RESTEasy, and many more.

Quarkus was designed for developers with the intent to be *easy to use* with features that work well with *little to no configuration*. It includes many features for developers, such as live coding so you can immediately check the effect of code changes and quickly troubleshoot them.

Quarkus was built around a *container-first* philosophy, meaning itâ€™s optimized for lower memory usage and faster startup times. Quarkus builds applications to consume 1/10th the memory when compared to traditional Java, and has a much faster startup time (as much as 300 times faster), both of which greatly reduce the cost of cloud resources.

In this lab, you will explore these features by:

* Creating a new Quarkus project
* Configuring the Quarkus application for OpenShift
* Deploying the Quarkus application to OpenShift
