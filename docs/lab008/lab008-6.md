# Cleaning Up

1. **Double check that you are in your own userNN-project by issuing the command**:

    ```bash
    oc project
    ```

    ???+ example "Example Output"

        ```bash
        user01@lab061 ~/openshift-quickstart $ oc project
        Using project "user01-project" on server "https://api.atsocppa.dmz:6443".

        ```

1. **Once you’re sure you’re in your own project, issue the following command to delete all objects** associated with your application labeled app.kubernetes.io/name=openshift-quickstart.  

    ```bash
    oc delete all --selector app.kubernetes.io/name=openshift-quickstart
    ```

    ???+ example "Example Output"

        ```bash
        user01@lab061:~/openshift-quickstart $ oc delete all --selector app.kubernetes.io/name=openshift-quickstart
        pod "openshift-quickstart-1-ztfq9" deleted
        replicationcontroller "openshift-quickstart-1" deleted
        service "openshift-quickstart" deleted
        deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io "openshift-quickstart" deleted
        buildconfig.build.openshift.io "openshift-quickstart" deleted
        build.build.openshift.io "openshift-quickstart-1" deleted
        imagestream.image.openshift.io "openjdk-11" deleted
        imagestream.image.openshift.io "openshift-quickstart" deleted
        route.route.openshift.io "openshift-quickstart" deleted
        ```

1. **To check that all of your mongo application resources were deleted, run the command**:

    ```bash
    oc get all
    ```

    ???+ example "Example Output"

        ```bash
        user01@lab061:~/openshift-quickstart $ oc get all
        No resources found.
        user00@lab061:~$
        ```

??? Note
    If there are leftover resources from other labs that you would like to delete, run the command:

    ```bash
    oc delete all --all 
    ```
