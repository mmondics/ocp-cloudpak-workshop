# Overview of the OpenShift Service Mesh

*Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh* (OSSM) provides a platform for behavioral insight and operational control over your networked microservices in a service mesh. With OSSM, you can connect, secure, and monitor microservices in your OpenShift Container Platform environment.

A *Service Mesh* is the network of microservices that make up applications and the interactions between those microservices. When a Service Mesh grows in size and complexity, it can become harder to understand and manage. Take, for example, an application made up of 5 microservices that is managed from the OpenShift Console and/or Command Line.

Based on the open source [Istio](https://istio.io/) project, OSSM adds a transparent layer on existing microservice applications without requiring any changes to the application code. You add OSSM support to services by deploying a sidecar proxy to relevant microservices in the mesh that intercepts all network communication between microservices. See the figure below.

OpenShift Service Mesh gives you an easy way to create a network of deployed services that provide:

* Discovery
* Load balancing
* Service-to-service authentication
* Failure recovery
* Metrics
* Monitoring

OpenShift Service Mesh also provides more complex operational functions including:

* A/B testing
* Canary releases
* Rate limiting
* Access control
* End-to-end authentication

In this lab, we will be exploring many of the OSSM features above.
