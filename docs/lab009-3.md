# Understanding and Deploying Tasks

!!! Important
    Work In Progress

A *Task* defines a series of steps that run in a desired order and complete a set amount of build work. Every Task runs as a Pod on your OpenShift cluster with each step as its own container. Tasks have one single responsibility so they can be reused across different Pipelines or in multiple places within a single Pipeline.

The repository you pulled includes the YAML files needed to create three Tasks. Letâ€™s take a look at one of them.

1. From the openshift-pipelines-s390x directory, run the command:

    ```bash
    cat tasks/hello.yaml
    ```

    ???+ example "Example Output"

        ```bash
        user01@lab061:~/openshift-pipelines-s390x$ cat tasks/hello.yaml
        apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
        kind: Task
        metadata:
        name: hello
        spec:
        steps:
            - name: say-hello
            image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi
            command:
                - /bin/bash
            args: ['-c', 'echo Hello World']
        ```

    This file will create a Kubernetes Task object called hello that is made up of one step. That step has its own name, image, command, and args associated with it. As explained above, once created, this Task will create one Pod that includes one Container.

1. Create the Task using the command

    ```bash
    oc create -f tasks/hello.yaml
    ```

    ???+ example "Example Output"

        ```bash
        user01@lab061:~/openshift-pipelines-s390x$ oc create -f tasks/hello.yaml
        task.tekton.dev/hello created
        ```

    The Task is now created in your project and can be run using Tekton, the CI/CD tool that OpenShift Pipelines are based on.

1. Run the hello task using the command

    ```bash
    tkn task start --showlog hello
    ```

    ???+ example "Example Output"

        ```bash
        user01@lab061:~/openshift-pipelines-s390x$ tkn task start --showlog hello
        TaskRun started: hello-run-xvr92
        Waiting for logs to be available...
        [say-hello] Hello World
        ```

    Running the `tkn task start` command created a new Kubernetes resource called a TaskRun. TaskRuns are automatically created for each Task that is run in a Pipeline, but as you can see, they can also be manually created by running a Task. This can be useful for debugging a single Task in a Pipeline.

1. Your Pipeline will consist of three Tasks total. Create the remaining Tasks using the commands:

    ```bash
    oc create -f tasks/apply_manifest_task.yaml
    ```

    and

    ```bash
    oc create -f tasks/update_deployment_task.yaml
    ```

    ???+ example "Example Output"

        ```bash
        user01@lab061:~/openshift-pipelines-s390x$ oc create -f tasks/apply_manifest_task.yaml
        task.tekton.dev/apply-manifests created
        user01@lab061:~/openshift-pipelines-s390x$ oc create -f tasks/update_deployment_task.yaml
        task.tekton.dev/update-deployment created
        ```

1. You have now created three Tasks that will be plumbed together to create a Pipeline. To see them, run the command:

    ```bash
    tkn task ls
    ```

    ???+ example "Example Output"

        ```bash
        user01@lab061:~/openshift-pipelines-s390x$ tkn task ls
        NAME                DESCRIPTION   AGE
        apply-manifests                   7 minutes ago
        hello                             8 minutes ago
        update-deployment                 7 minutes ago
        ```

    You will also need a *Workspace* in which your will run all of the Tasks associated with your Pipeline. This will be a shared space across each Task, TaskRun, Pipeline, and PipelineRun that you associate with the Workspace. With a Workspace, you can store Task inputs and outputs, share data among Tasks, use it as a mount point for credentials held in Secrets, create a cache of build artifacts that speed up jobs, and more.

1. In our case, we will be using a PersistentVolumeClaim as our Workspace. Create the PVC using the command:

    ```bash
    oc create -f resources/persistent_volume_claim.yaml
    ```

    ???+ example "Example Output"

        ```bash
        user01@lab061:~/openshift-pipelines-s390x$ oc create -f resources/persistent_volume_claim.yaml
        persistentvolumeclaim/source-pvc created
        ```

In the next section, you will create a Pipeline that uses the Tasks and Workspace you just created to pull the source code of an application from GitHub and then builds and deploys it in a container on OpenShift.
