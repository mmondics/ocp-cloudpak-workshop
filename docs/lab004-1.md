# Lab 004 - Deploying an Application from Source Code

OpenShift is designed for users with various responsibilities, backgrounds and skillsets. Most broadly, OpenShift is designed for two main groups – *administrators* and *developers*. Furthermore, there are different types of administrators, and different types of developers.

As much of the Information Technology world moves toward cloud technology as the consumption model for enterprise computing, developers are required to make a shift in the tools they use to perform their work. At the heart of almost every cloud platform there are two of these new, core technologies – *containers* and *container orchestrators*.

???+ Note
    We won’t be specifically covering these technologies in this lab, but you’ve probably heard of them. Docker is the most popular container runtime, and Kubernetes is the most popular container orchestrator. For the curious, OpenShift replaced Docker containers with CRI-O containers when moving from v3.11 to v4.1 (although Docker containers will still work in OpenShift 4.x).

However, not every developer wants (or needs) to learn these new technologies in order to take advantage of them. In fact, OpenShift enables developers with no container experience at all to simply provide their source code (written in Javascript, Python, Go, etc.) and let OpenShift build the container for them using its ***Source-to-Image (S2I) capability***.
