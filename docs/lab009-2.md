# Cloning the GitHub Repository and Viewing its Contents

!!! Important
    Work In Progress

In the terminal session, you should have been automatically placed in your home directory `/home/userNN` (where NN is your user number).

1. **Run the command `pwd` to check your current working directory**.

    ???+ example "Example Output"

        ```bash
        user01@lab061:~$ pwd
        /home/user01
        ```

1. If you are in any other directory, **change into the correct home directory using the command `cd /home/userNN`** (where NN is your user number).

    ???+ example "Example Output"

        ```bash
        user01@lab061:~$ cd /home/user01
        user01@lab061:~$ pwd
        /home/user01
        ```
1. In your home directory, **clone the OpenShift Pipelines repository using the command**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mmondics/openshift-pipelines-s390x 
    ```

    ???+ example "Example Output"

        ```bash
        user01@lab061:~$ git clone https://github.com/mmondics/openshift-pipelines-s390x
        Cloning into 'openshift-pipelines-s390x'...
        remote: Enumerating objects: 25, done.
        remote: Counting objects: 100% (25/25), done.
        remote: Compressing objects: 100% (21/21), done.
        remote: Total 25 (delta 5), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
        Unpacking objects: 100% (25/25), done.
        Checking connectivity... done
        ```

1. This will create a new directory called `openliberty-pipelines-s390x`. Change into this directory using the command:

    ```bash
    cd openshift-pipelines-s390x
    ```

1. List its contents using the command:

    ```bash
    ls -l
    ```

    ???+ example "Example Output"

        ```bash
        user01@lab061:~$ cd openliberty-operator-ocpz
        user01@lab061:~/openliberty-operator-ocpz$ ls -l
        total 16
