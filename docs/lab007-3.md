# Cloning the GitHub Repository and Reviewing its Contents

!!! Important
    Work In Progress

In the terminal session, you should have been automatically placed in your home directory `/home/userNN` (where NN is your user number).

1. **Run the command `pwd` to check your current working directory**.

    ???+ example "Example Output"

        ```
        user01@lab061:~$ pwd
        /home/user01
        ```

1. If you are in any other directory, **change into the correct home directory using the command `cd /home/userNN`** (where NN is your user number).

    ???+ example "Example Output"

        ```
        user01@lab061:~$ cd /home/user01
        user01@lab061:~$ pwd
        /home/user01
        ```

1. In your home directory, **clone the Open Liberty Operator repository using the command**:

    **`git clone https://github.com/mmondics/openliberty-operator-ocpz`**

    ???+ example "Example Output"

        ```
        user01@lab061:~$ git clone https://github.com/mmondics/openliberty-operator-ocpz
        Cloning into 'openliberty-operator-ocpz'...
        remote: Enumerating objects: 70, done.
        remote: Counting objects: 100% (70/70), done.
        remote: Compressing objects: 100% (68/68), done.
        remote: Total 70 (delta 30), reused 2 (delta 1), pack-reused 0
        Unpacking objects: 100% (70/70), done.
        Checking connectivity... done.
        ```

1. This will create a new directory called `openliberty-operator-ocpz`. **Change into this directory using the command `cd openliberty-operator-ocpz`, then list its contents using the command `ls -l`**.

    ???+ example "Example Output"
        ```

        user01@lab061:~$ cd openliberty-operator-ocpz
        user01@lab061:~/openliberty-operator-ocpz$ ls -l
        total 24

    ??? Information "Expand for More Information"
        If you navigate to the GitHub in a web browser (<https://github.com/mmondics/openliberty-operator-ocpz>), you will notice that the sub-directories in your Linux session reflect the folders contained in the repository.

        | File | Description |
        |---|---|
        |     README.md    |     Contains the content displayed on the GitHub page for this   repository. You can read through this README file if you want to get more   information about this lab.     |
        |     admin-ol-operator-install    |     Directory used to install the Open Liberty Operator onto   the OpenShift cluster. Since this has been done ahead of time, you won’t be   using this directory.    |
        |     images    |     Contains the images referenced in the README.md file and   displayed on the GitHub page for this repository.    |
        |     ol-app-install    |     Contains all of the files needed to build, push, and   deploy the Mod Resorts sample application. This is where we will be doing our   work for this lab.    |

1. **Change into the `ol-app-install` directory using the command `cd ol-app-install` and list its contents using the command `ls -l`**

    ???+ example "Example Output"
        ```

        user01@lab061:~$ cd ol-app-install
        user01@lab061:~/openliberty-operator-ocpz/ol-app-install$ ls -l
