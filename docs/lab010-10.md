# Wrap Up & Clean Up

In this lab, you have explored many of the features that come as part of OpenShift Service Mesh. OSSM is an extremely powerful OpenShift add-on, and we were not able to fit all of its features into this lab. You can find more information & tutorials at the following documentation links:

* OpenShift Service Mesh: <https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.7/service_mesh/v2x/ossm-about.html>

* Kiali: <https://kiali.io/documentation/>
* Jaeger: <https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.24/>
