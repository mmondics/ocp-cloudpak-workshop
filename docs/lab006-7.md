# Cleaning Up

!!! Important
    Work In Progress

There is no easy way to delete all of these objects from the OpenShift console. This is a much easier task in the OpenShift command line.

1. In the OpenShift CLI, **make sure you are in your own project** (i.e. userNN-project) **and run the following command**:

    `oc delete all --selector app=node-s-2-i-openshift -o name`

    ???+ Note
        If you are not connected to the OpenShift command line, refer to Lab 002 â€“ Using the OpenShift Command Line (`oc`).

This will delete most of the objects in your project, but not the Persistent Volume Claim you created.

1. **To delete the PVC, run the command**:

    `oc delete pvc/pvc-userNN` (where NN is your user number).
