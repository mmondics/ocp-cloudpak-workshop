        You might see a security challenge if the cluster has not yet been accessed from your workstation. Accept the challenge to continue.

    You should now see login page prompting your OpenShift credentials.

1. **Log into Grafana using the your OpenShift credentials**.

    * Username: userNN
    * Password: p@ssw0rd

    Notice that the credentials you use to log into Grafana are the same as those you use to log into OpenShift itself. OpenShiftâ€™s role-bases access control (RBAC) functionality extends to the monitoring stack, so administrators can control who can see this part of the environment.
