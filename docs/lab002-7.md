# Administrative CLI Commands

!!! Important
    Work in Progress

If you’ve already completed [Lab 001 – Exploring the OpenShift Console](lab001-1.md), you’ll remember that there are both developer and administrator perspectives. The same is true in the OpenShift CLI. 

The `oc adm` command gives cluster administrators the ability to check logs, manage users, groups, policies, certificates, and many other tasks usually associated with administrative roles.

1. Issue the `oc adm --help` command to see all of the OpenShift administrator commands.

        user01@lab061:~$ oc adm --help

    ???+ Note
        Your userNN credential has the privileges required to run some, but not all of these commands.

1. **Run the command `oc adm top pods`** to show see usage statistics for pods in your project.

    ???+ example "Example Output"
        ```
        user01@lab061:~$ oc adm top pods
        NAME            CPU(cores)   MEMORY(bytes)   
        mongodb-1-5nmjn   3m           83Mi            
        mongodb-1-dh49x   3m           83Mi            
        mongodb-1-r8dpw   3m           85Mi
        ```

    As OpenShift clusters grow in production, administrative commands like this one become more and more essential to keep everything running smoothly.
